# Malware Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository holds all code base and details for the project Malware Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms submitted in partial fulfilment of my Master's Degree. This repository holds several Jupyter notebooks at several stages/implementations of the project. The consists of the following:

- 01 - Dataset Loading and Preparation
- 02 - Feature Importance/Selection
- 03 - Principal Component Analysis
- 04 - Random Forest Classifier Implementation
- 05 -Naive Bayes Algorithm Implementation
- 06 -K-Neartest Neighbour Algorithm Implementation
- 07- Support Vector Machines Algorithm Implementation
